# shutTheBox
I recreated the board game "Shut the Box" with Python. The file "shutTheBoxPrototype.py" is just a Prototype that prints in the console without using GUI.
"shutTheBox.py" is the actual finished programm where it shows the programm with an GUI, I used tkinter.

Shut the Box is a board game with two dices and a board with numbers from 1 through 9. The goal is to close all 'numbers' of the board.
You can close up to two fields at once, the numbers have to add up to the two dices (You can also just close one)
You loose if it isn't possible anymore to close fields that add up to the right number before everything is closed.

I had the idea to do this while seeing a tiktok of someone playing this game (@joshua_cubed)

I'm a beginner to programming, if you have any improvements ect. let me know!
